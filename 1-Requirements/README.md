# Requirements
## Introduction


* A Parking Guidance System helps in proper allocation of the parking spot to the vehicles. The system will help the drivers with the exact location, where to park. The System also holds the data of the car driver and the car. With this data, we can calculate what charges are to be paid for differrent type of vehicles and how long the vehicle was parked.

## Research
---

* Many a times we have noticed long queues in the parking lot.
* The possible reasons are:
    * People inside are finding a parking spot.
    * Someone is having an arguement regarding the spot. (I saw it first!!!)
    * The manager might run out of paper and is unable to make tickets.(After all it's india, anything can happen here!!!)
* The Parking charges depends on the type of the vehicle and how long the vehicle was parked.

## Cost and Features
---
* The system might cost around 50,000 INR.
* The system consists of a software to collect the data and store it.
* The indication mechanism is required for indicating the parking spot location.
* The data used can be used for future infrastructure improvements.
* The system will ensure security as each and every car is allocated a specific spot. So, if some ransom vehicle is parked the system will raise an alert.
* As managemnet becomes fast, more vehicles can be accomadated, generating more revenue.
* The system installation cost can be recovered within a year.


## Defining Our System
---
* The system is made with a goal that whenever a car arrives at the start point, it gets a specific location assigned to park their vehicle.
* The empty spots should be counted continuosly such that the real time data is available to the manager.
* The system notes down the entry time and exit time, accordingly the charges will be calculated.
* The system has to assign the nearest spot possible to the vehicles.
* The system should update the count whenever the vehicle left the spot vacant.
